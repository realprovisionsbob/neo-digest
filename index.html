                fullText: `<p>Chinese companies are accelerating the rollout of new artificial intelligence models as competition with U.S.-based rivals OpenAI, Anthropic and Google intensifies.</p>
                <p>Just over a year ago, China-made DeepSeek rocked global markets with the release of an AI chatbot that undercut OpenAI's ChatGPT on usage fees and production costs, raising questions about the efficacy of U.S. tech restrictions on China.</p>
                <p>On Tuesday, Beijing-based startup Moonshot AI revealed Kimi K2.5, which claimed to have video-generation and agentic capabilities that outperformed all three of the leading U.S. AI models. Agentic AI broadly refers to AI systems capable of carrying out tasks on behalf of people.</p>
                <p>Hours earlier, e-commerce giant Alibaba announced its latest generative AI model. Alibaba claimed its Qwen3-Max-Thinking outperformed major U.S. rivals on a broad benchmark test called "Humanity's Last Exam."</p>
                <p>Alibaba said the new model can automatically select the best AI tool for a range of tasks and draw on past conversations as context to generate new responses more efficiently.</p>
                <p>Also last week, Hong Kong-traded shares of Chinese tech giant Baidu climbed to their highest level in nearly three years following the release of its latest generative AI model, Ernie 5.0.</p>
                <p>Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, told CNBC this month that China's AI models may be just "months" behind those developed in the U.S.</p>`,

                <p>The integration would leverage Worldcoin's "proof of personhood" system, which uses iris scans to verify that users are real humans rather than AI bots.</p>

                <p>Worldcoin's World ID system could become the foundation for a new kind of social network where every participant is verified as human.</p>
